## üç∏ Bar Assistant

Bar Assistant is all-in-one solution for managing your home bar. Compared to other recipe management software that usually tries to be more for general use, Bar Assistant is made specifically for managing cocktail recipes. This means that there are a lot of cocktail-oriented features, like ingredient substitutes, first-class ingredients, ABV calculations, unit switching and more.

This repository only contains the API server, if you are looking for easy to use web client, take a look at [Salt Rim](https://github.com/karlomikus/vue-salt-rim).
