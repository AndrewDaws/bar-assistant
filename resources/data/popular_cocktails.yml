    description: |-
        The Japanese cocktail is notorious for a handful of things: it's a very old cocktail, published in Jerry Thomas’s landmark 1862 book How to Mix Drinks; it was the first mixed drink to be named something other than “Whiskey Cocktail”, “Brandy Cocktail”, or some other similarly obvious epithet; it might be the only cocktail Thomas invented himself; and finally, it was the first cocktail to feature more than a dash of a fancy sweetener, orgeat.

    name: 'Amaretto Sour'
    description: |-
        Amaretto is an Italian liqueur that’s typically flavored with almonds or apricot stones. Its distinctive flavor can be incorporated into numerous cocktails, but it’s best known for the Amaretto Sour, a drink that tends to get a bad rap. That’s because, too often, the cocktail is overly sweet and relies on premade sour mix. 
    instructions: |-
        1. Combine all ingredients and, if using an egg white, dry shake
        2. Add ice and shake for 10 sec
        3. Strain into a coupe, serve up

    name: 'Gin & Tonic'
    description: |-
        Called a “G and T” or gin tonic in some countries, this refreshing drink is made in countries all around the world. The Gin and Tonic was invented in the 1850’s by British soldiers, who mixed gin with their tonic water as a way to drink quinine (which was thought to cure malaria). Tonic water of today no longer has quinine, but the drink stuck around!
    instructions: |-
        1. Add lots of ice to a large cocktail or wine glass and stir to chill the glass. Drain any melted water.
        2. Pour in the gin. Add the garnishes. Pour the tonic water onto a bar spoon into the glass (to increase the bubbles). Stir once and serve.

        The word "gimlet" used in this sense is first attested in 1928. The most obvious derivation is from the tool for drilling small holes, a word also used figuratively to describe something as sharp or piercing. Thus, the cocktail may have been named for its "penetrating" effects on the drinker.
    instructions: |-
        1. Add gin, lime juice, and syrup to a cocktail shaker. Fill with ice and shake until cold.
        2. Strain into glass and top with a splash of soda water, if desired.

        A punch, sangria traditionally consists of red wine and chopped fruit, often with other ingredients or spirits.

        Sangria is very popular among foreign tourists in Spain even if locals do not consume the beverage that much. It is commonly served in bars, restaurants, and chiringuitos and at festivities throughout Portugal and Spain.
    instructions: |-
        1. Chop the orange (leaving the peel on) and apple into bite-sized chunks, then add them to the bottom of a pitcher. Sprinkle them with sugar and stir. Let them stand for 20 minutes at room temperature.
        2. After 20 minutes, pour in the red wine, brandy, orange liqueur, and lemon rounds. Stir and refrigerate 1 to 4 hours. (Don’t go beyond 4 hours or the fruit texture starts to degrade.)
        3. Pour the sangria into ice filled glasses and top with a splash of sparkling water (if desired). Add fruit to each glass, preferably on long skewers for easy snacking.

    name: Štrukani Pelin
    description: Štrukani pelinkovac (or štrukani pelin) is a somewhat novel Croatian drink that combines pelinkovac (traditional herbal liqueur) with lemon juice. In its basic form, the drink is made with pelinkovac that is poured into an ice-filled glass.
    instructions: |-
        1. A lemon slice is then squeezed directly into the glass and mixed.

        The amount of lemon juice can vary, sometimes resulting in a drink with equal amounts of both ingredients. More elaborate versions often add orange juice, citrus zest, or spices.
    garnish: Lemon wedge
