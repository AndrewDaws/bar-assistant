    name: 'Japanese cocktail'
    description: |-
        The Japanese cocktail is notorious for a handful of things: it's a very old cocktail, published in Jerry Thomas’s landmark 1862 book How to Mix Drinks; it was the first mixed drink to be named something other than “Whiskey Cocktail”, “Brandy Cocktail”, or some other similarly obvious epithet; it might be the only cocktail Thomas invented himself; and finally, it was the first cocktail to feature more than a dash of a fancy sweetener, orgeat.

    name: 'Amaretto Sour'
    description: |-
        Amaretto is an Italian liqueur that’s typically flavored with almonds or apricot stones. Its distinctive flavor can be incorporated into numerous cocktails, but it’s best known for the Amaretto Sour, a drink that tends to get a bad rap. That’s because, too often, the cocktail is overly sweet and relies on premade sour mix. 
    instructions: |-
        1. Combine all ingredients and, if using an egg white, dry shake
        2. Add ice and shake for 10 sec
        3. Strain into a coupe, serve up
