        The Alexander cocktail was born in London in 1922 by Hery Mc Elhone, at Ciro’s Club in honor of a famous bride, at the beginning it was called Panama, Gin was used instead of Cognac and light cocoa cream instead of dark.

        **Alexandra**: Use the light cocoa cream instead of the dark one and replace the nutmeg with cocoa.

        **Alexander’s Sister**: Use crème de menthe instead of crème de cacao

        **Alejandro**: Replace cognac with rum

    name: Americano
    description: |-
        The story of the Americano dates back to the second half of the 1800s in Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan.  Over the years the cocktail acquires notoriety thanks to some homages from the world of cinema, including James Bond (007 Casino Royale) whose favorite cocktail was, precisely, the Americano.

        The nickname “American” was born when Primo Carnera, a giant Italian boxer, became world heavyweight champion at Madison Square Garden in New York.  When Carnera returned to Italy with the title, he was greeted with this very Italian cocktail which, for the occasion, was called “Americano”.

        The Americano entered the IBA Cocktail List only in 1987 but, in reality, it was a cocktail that spread all over Italy during the 1930s.

    name: 'Angel Face'
    description: |-
        Although the origin of the cocktail is not known, the main hypotheses assume that it was born in the twenties of the twentieth century in France: this thesis would prove the presence of calvados, a liqueur commonly used in France and, in particular, in that period, as an epidemic of phylloxera in European vineyards had limited the production of brandy.
        On this basis, one of the most frequent hypotheses has it that the cocktail was created by Harry MacElhone, founder of Harry’s New York Bar in Paris on July 19, 1919, in honor of the celebrations for the victory of the First World War.
        The first reliable evidence, however, dates back to 1930 when Harry Craddock included the Angel Face among the recipes of his book “Savoy cocktail book”. Some sources indicate that the name derives from that of an American gangster active during Prohibition; less likely the dedication to Rick Blaine, the protagonist of Casablanca played by Humphrey Bogart, as the film follows the first testimonies (1942).

    name: Aviation
    description: |-
        Aviation was created in New York at the Walkick hotel by the head bartender Hugo Ensslin while he was writing his book “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” (1916) one of the last cocktail books published before the start of American Prohibition.

        Lately David Wondrich found the aviation recipe in a 1911 magazine, so the recipe is thought to have been born earlier then 1916.

        In his book Ensslin also indicates the type of Gin to be used ‘El Bart Gin “and the recipe is made up in addition to gin, with lemon juice, maraschino and Creme di Violette.

        The recipe is found again in Harry Craddock’s 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book but without the Creme de Violette, this probably due to the difficulty of finding the violet cream during the post-war period In the 1960s it was still unavailable and therefore, simply, the basic ingredient of the Aviation cocktail was discontinued and the bartenders definitively gave up the characteristic blue color of the drink.

        The IBA proposes it today in its original version with the creme de violette which is now on the market again.  This fragrant ingredient not only gave the mix a sweetly floral taste, but also gave it a beautiful sky blue color.

        Although the origin of the drink is unknown, one account says it came about around 1918 in the region of Alentejo in Portugal, with a popular recipe made with lemon, garlic, and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Another account is that Caipirinha is based on Poncha, an alcoholic drink from Madeira, Portugal. The main ingredient is aguardente de cana, which is made from sugar cane. Sugar cane production was switched from Madeira to Brazil by the Portuguese as they needed more land to plant it on. Before this people in Madeira had already created aguardente de cana, which was the ancestor to cachaça.

        Variations:

        **CAIPIROSKA** – Instead of Cachaça use Vodka;
    instructions: |-
        1. Place lime and sugar into a double old fashioned glass and muddle gently.
        2. Fill the glass with cracked ice and add Cachaça.
        3. Stir gently to involve ingredients.

It was further popularized among young women by its frequent mention on the television program Sex and the City, where Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Carrie Bradshaw, commonly ordered the drink when out with her girlfriends. The film adaptation made a reference to its popularity when Miranda asks why they stopped drinking them, Carrie replies "because everyone else started."

        The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanish–American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most-popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.

        Traditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola ("Coke") and the alcohol is a light rum such as Bacardi; however, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included.

        The cocktail first became popular among the youth of the college town of Córdoba, in the 1980s and—impulsed by an advertising campaign led by Fratelli Branca—its consumption grew in popularity during the following decades to become widespread throughout the country, surpassed only by that of beer and wine. It is now considered a cultural icon of Argentina and is especially associated with its home province of Córdoba, where the drink is most consumed. The popularity of fernet con coca is such that Argentina consumes more than 75% of all fernet produced globally. The cocktail can also be found in some of its bordering countries, like Uruguay.

        Although typically made with Fernet-Branca and Coca-Cola, several amaro brands have appeared in Argentina since its popularization, as well as ready-to-drink versions.

        The Hanky-Panky was the brainchild of Ada Coleman (known as "Coley") who began as a bartender at the Savoy Hotel in 1903. Her benefactor was Rupert D'Oyly Carte, a member of the family that first produced Gilbert and Sullivan operas in London and that built the Savoy Hotel. When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy, Ada was given a position at the hotel's American Bar, where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, and Sir Charles Hawtrey.

        Coleman created the Hanky-Panky for Hawtrey. He was a Victorian and Edwardian actor who mentored Noël Coward.

    description: 'Popular history suggests that the drink originated at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the mid-1870s, where it was invented by Iain Marshall for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, mother of Winston) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. The success of the banquet made the drink fashionable, later prompting several people to request the drink by referring to the name of the club where it originated—"the Manhattan cocktail". However, Lady Randolph was in France at the time and pregnant, so the story is likely a fiction.'
    instructions: 'Pour all ingredients into mixing glass with ice cubes. Stir well. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.'

        It serves as the basis for many modern cocktails, and several different versions of the original exist.
        These are generally distinguished by the accompaniment of either Maraschino or Curacao, as well as differences in gin or bitters.

Blanco tequila is the traditional choice, but lightly aged reposado also makes a fine drink. In this case, it’s best to keep the añejo capped, as the well-aged expression’s oaky profile disrupts that clean, refreshing taste you want in a Paloma. '

        A pisco sour is an alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian origin that is typical of the cuisines from Peru. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components.
        The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lemon juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters.
        The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white.
        Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.
    instructions: |-
        Add all ingredients into a shaker with ice.
        Shake and strain into a chilled goblet glass.
    garnish: 'Few dashes of Amargo or Angostura bitters on top as an aromatic garnish.'

    name: Sazerac
    description: |-
        The Sazerac is a local variation of a cognac or whiskey cocktail originally from New Orleans, named for the Sazerac de Forge et Fils brand of cognac brandy that served as its original main ingredient.
        The drink is most traditionally a combination of cognac or rye whiskey, absinthe, Peychaud's Bitters, and sugar, although bourbon whiskey is sometimes substituted for the rye and Herbsaint is sometimes substituted for the absinthe.
        Some claim it is the oldest known American cocktail, with origins in antebellum New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is among those who dispute this, and American instances of published usage of the word cocktail to describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century.
    instructions: |-
        1. Rinse a chilled old-fashioned glass with the absinthe.
        2. Add crushed ice and set it aside.
        3. Stir the remaining ingredients over ice in a mixing glass.
        4. Discard the ice and any excess absinthe from the prepared glass.
        5. Strain the mixed drink into the glass.

    name: Sidecar
    description: |-
        The exact origin of the sidecar is unclear, but it is thought to have been invented around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. The drink was directly named for the motorcycle attachment, which was very commonly used back then.

        Like the daiquiri, the sidecar evolved from the original sour formula, but sidecars are often drier than sours, combining liqueurs like curaçao with citrus. Sidecars are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness.
