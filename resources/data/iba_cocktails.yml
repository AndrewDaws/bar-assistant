- name: Americano
  description: |-
    The story of the Americano dates back to the second half of the 1800s in Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan.  Over the years the cocktail acquires notoriety thanks to some homages from the world of cinema, including James Bond (007 Casino Royale) whose favorite cocktail was, precisely, the Americano.

    The nickname “American” was born when Primo Carnera, a giant Italian boxer, became world heavyweight champion at Madison Square Garden in New York.  When Carnera returned to Italy with the title, he was greeted with this very Italian cocktail which, for the occasion, was called “Americano”.

    The Americano entered the IBA Cocktail List only in 1987 but, in reality, it was a cocktail that spread all over Italy during the 1930s.
  ingredients:
    - 30 ml Campari
    - 30 ml Sweet Vermouth
    - 1 splash Club soda
  instructions: |-
    1. Mix the ingredients directly in an old fashioned glass filled with ice cubes.
    2. Add a splash of Soda Water.
    3. Stir gently.

    - The Unforgettables
- name: Angel Face
  description: |-
    Although the origin of the cocktail is not known, the main hypotheses assume that it was born in the twenties of the twentieth century in France: this thesis would prove the presence of calvados, a liqueur commonly used in France and, in particular, in that period, as an epidemic of phylloxera in European vineyards had limited the production of brandy.
    On this basis, one of the most frequent hypotheses has it that the cocktail was created by Harry MacElhone, founder of Harry’s New York Bar in Paris on July 19, 1919, in honor of the celebrations for the victory of the First World War.
    The first reliable evidence, however, dates back to 1930 when Harry Craddock included the Angel Face among the recipes of his book “Savoy cocktail book”. Some sources indicate that the name derives from that of an American gangster active during Prohibition; less likely the dedication to Rick Blaine, the protagonist of Casablanca played by Humphrey Bogart, as the film follows the first testimonies (1942).
  ingredients:
    - 30 ml Gin
    - 30 ml Apricot Brandy
    - 30 ml Calvados
  instructions: |-
    1. Pour all ingredients into cocktail shaker filled with ice cubes.

  description: |-
    Aviation was created in New York at the Walkick hotel by the head bartender Hugo Ensslin while he was writing his book “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” (1916) one of the last cocktail books published before the start of American Prohibition.

    Lately David Wondrich found the aviation recipe in a 1911 magazine, so the recipe is thought to have been born earlier then 1916.

    In his book Ensslin also indicates the type of Gin to be used ‘El Bart Gin “and the recipe is made up in addition to gin, with lemon juice, maraschino and Creme di Violette.

    The recipe is found again in Harry Craddock’s 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book but without the Creme de Violette, this probably due to the difficulty of finding the violet cream during the post-war period In the 1960s it was still unavailable and therefore, simply, the basic ingredient of the Aviation cocktail was discontinued and the bartenders definitively gave up the characteristic blue color of the drink.

    The IBA proposes it today in its original version with the creme de violette which is now on the market again.  This fragrant ingredient not only gave the mix a sweetly floral taste, but also gave it a beautiful sky blue color.
  ingredients:
    - 45 ml Gin
    - 15 ml Maraschino
    - 15 ml Lemon juice
    - 1 teaspoon Crème de Violette
  instructions: |-
    1. Add all ingredients into a cocktail shaker.

    Although the origin of the drink is unknown, one account says it came about around 1918 in the region of Alentejo in Portugal, with a popular recipe made with lemon, garlic, and honey, indicated for patients with the Spanish flu. Another account is that Caipirinha is based on Poncha, an alcoholic drink from Madeira, Portugal. The main ingredient is aguardente de cana, which is made from sugar cane. Sugar cane production was switched from Madeira to Brazil by the Portuguese as they needed more land to plant it on. Before this people in Madeira had already created aguardente de cana, which was the ancestor to cachaça.

    Variations:

    **CAIPIROSKA** – Instead of Cachaça use Vodka;
  ingredients:
    - 60 ml Cachaça
    - 4 wedge Lime

- name: Paloma
  description: |-
    The Paloma is a refreshing, easy-to-make cooler that combines tequila, lime juice and grapefruit soda. Its origin story is nebulous, but most reports peg its creation to the 1950s. Blanco tequila is the traditional choice, but lightly aged reposado also makes a fine drink. In this case, it’s best to keep the añejo capped, as the well-aged expression’s oaky profile disrupts that clean, refreshing taste you want in a Paloma. 
  ingredients:
    - 50 ml Tequila
    - 5 ml lime juice
    - 1 pinch salt
    - 100 ml Grapefruit juice
  instructions:
    - Poor the tequila into a highball glass, squeeze the lime juice. Add ice and salt,
      fill up pink grapefruit soda. Stir gently.
  garnish: Garnish with a slice of lime.

- name: Sazerac
  description: |-
    The Sazerac is a local variation of a cognac or whiskey cocktail originally from New Orleans, named for the Sazerac de Forge et Fils brand of cognac brandy that served as its original main ingredient.
    The drink is most traditionally a combination of cognac or rye whiskey, absinthe, Peychaud's Bitters, and sugar, although bourbon whiskey is sometimes substituted for the rye and Herbsaint is sometimes substituted for the absinthe.
    Some claim it is the oldest known American cocktail, with origins in antebellum New Orleans, although drink historian David Wondrich is among those who dispute this, and American instances of published usage of the word cocktail to describe a mixture of spirits, bitters, and sugar can be traced to the dawn of the 19th century.
  ingredients:
    - 50 ml Cognac
    - 10 ml Absinthe
    - 1 cube Sugar
    - 2 Dashes Peychauds Bitters
  instructions: |-
    1. Rinse a chilled old-fashioned glass with the absinthe.
    2. Add crushed ice and set it aside.
    3. Stir the remaining ingredients over ice in a mixing glass.
    4. Discard the ice and any excess absinthe from the prepared glass.
    5. Strain the mixed drink into the glass.

- name: Sidecar
  description: |-
    The exact origin of the sidecar is unclear, but it is thought to have been invented around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. The drink was directly named for the motorcycle attachment, which was very commonly used back then.

    Like the daiquiri, the sidecar evolved from the original sour formula, but sidecars are often drier than sours, combining liqueurs like curaçao with citrus. Sidecars are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness.
  ingredients:
    - 50 ml Cognac
    - 20 ml Triple Sec
    - 20 ml Lemon juice
  instructions:
    - Pour all ingredients into a cocktail shaker, shake well with ice, strain into
      a chilled cocktail glass.
