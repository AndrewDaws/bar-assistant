- name: Americano
  description: |-
    The story of the Americano dates back to the second half of the 1800s in Gaspare Campari’s bar in Milan.  Over the years the cocktail acquires notoriety thanks to some homages from the world of cinema, including James Bond (007 Casino Royale) whose favorite cocktail was, precisely, the Americano.

    The nickname “American” was born when Primo Carnera, a giant Italian boxer, became world heavyweight champion at Madison Square Garden in New York.  When Carnera returned to Italy with the title, he was greeted with this very Italian cocktail which, for the occasion, was called “Americano”.

    The Americano entered the IBA Cocktail List only in 1987 but, in reality, it was a cocktail that spread all over Italy during the 1930s.
  ingredients:
    - 30 ml Campari
    - 30 ml Sweet Vermouth
    - 1 splash Club soda
  instructions: |-
    1. Mix the ingredients directly in an old fashioned glass filled with ice cubes.
    2. Add a splash of Soda Water.
    3. Stir gently.
  garnish: Garnish with half orange slice and a lemon zest.

    - The Unforgettables
- name: Angel Face
  description: |-
    Although the origin of the cocktail is not known, the main hypotheses assume that it was born in the twenties of the twentieth century in France: this thesis would prove the presence of calvados, a liqueur commonly used in France and, in particular, in that period, as an epidemic of phylloxera in European vineyards had limited the production of brandy.
    On this basis, one of the most frequent hypotheses has it that the cocktail was created by Harry MacElhone, founder of Harry’s New York Bar in Paris on July 19, 1919, in honor of the celebrations for the victory of the First World War.
    The first reliable evidence, however, dates back to 1930 when Harry Craddock included the Angel Face among the recipes of his book “Savoy cocktail book”. Some sources indicate that the name derives from that of an American gangster active during Prohibition; less likely the dedication to Rick Blaine, the protagonist of Casablanca played by Humphrey Bogart, as the film follows the first testimonies (1942).
  ingredients:
    - 30 ml Gin
    - 30 ml Apricot Brandy
    - 30 ml Calvados
  instructions: |-
    1. Pour all ingredients into cocktail shaker filled with ice cubes.

  description: |-
    Aviation was created in New York at the Walkick hotel by the head bartender Hugo Ensslin while he was writing his book “Recipes for Mixed Drinks” (1916) one of the last cocktail books published before the start of American Prohibition.

    Lately David Wondrich found the aviation recipe in a 1911 magazine, so the recipe is thought to have been born earlier then 1916.

    In his book Ensslin also indicates the type of Gin to be used ‘El Bart Gin “and the recipe is made up in addition to gin, with lemon juice, maraschino Luxardo and Creme di Violette.

    The recipe is found again in Harry Craddock’s 1930 Savoy Cocktail Book but without the Creme de Violette, this probably due to the difficulty of finding the violet cream during the post-war period In the 1960s it was still unavailable and therefore, simply, the basic ingredient of the Aviation cocktail was discontinued and the bartenders definitively gave up the characteristic blue color of the drink.

    The IBA proposes it today in its original version with the creme de violette which is now on the market again.  This fragrant ingredient not only gave the mix a sweetly floral taste, but also gave it a beautiful sky blue color.
  ingredients:
    - 45 ml Gin
    - 15 ml Maraschino Luxardo
    - 15 ml Lemon juice
    - 1 teaspoon Crème de Violette
  instructions: |-
    1. Add all ingredients into a cocktail shaker.
    2. Shake with cracked ice and strain into a chilled cocktail glass.
  garnish: Optional Maraschino Cherry.
